# Overview
## Tandem Arcus Backend Coding Excercise
API for accessing users and notes.

### The Notes entity was added due to a misreading of the requirements.

In the instructions, there is a subheading labled *Get notes*, which means "notes about GET functionality for Users". I, for some reason, intrepreted it to mean *GET Notes*, with Notes being a separate entity to be logically implemented.  I realized I had misread things at some point, but I didn't see any reason to remove the work I had done, so there's an extra entity and related functionality in what I'm submitting.

Thank you,
